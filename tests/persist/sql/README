                        HOWTO Run the SQL Tests
                        -----------------------

The test in this directory is disabled, because it requires some
manual configuration in order to make it work. Most users don't
bother with this configuration, so we disable it to avoid grief.

To run this test, perform the following steps:

1) Edit the CMakefile, uncomment the test.

2) Configure an SQL server, as described in opencog/persist/sql/README
   Abreiviated instructions follow below; else skip to step 3.

2a) Install the postgres server, the postgress client, unixodbc and
    odbc-postgresql

2b) Edit /etc/odbcinst.ini and copy the example config into there.
    Use the Unicode drivers, not the ANSI (ASCII) drivers. Opencog
    uses unicode.

2c) Create a test database. This can be done at the shell prompt: 

    $ createdb test-persist

2d) Create a database user named opencog_tester with password 'cheese'.
    You can pick a different username and password, but it must be
    consistent with the ~/.odbc.ini file. Do NOT use your login password!
    Pick something else! Create the user at the shell prompt:

    $ psql -c "CREATE USER opencog_tester WITH PASSWORD 'cheese'"

2e) edit ~/.odbc.ini and add something similar to the following:

    [opencog_test]
    Description = Unit-Test DB for Opencog unit tests.
    Driver      = PostgreSQL
    Trace       = 0
    TraceFile   =
    CommLog     = No
    Database    = persist-test
    Servername  = localhost
    Port        = 5432
    Username    = opencog
    Password    = cheese
    ReadOnly    = No
    RowVersioning     = No
    ShowSystemTables  = Yes
    ShowOidColumn     = Yes
    FakeOidIndex      = Yes
    ConnSettings      =


4) 
4) edit lib/opencog-test.conf and set the username

3) run the test case: ./tests/scm/BasicSCMUTest
