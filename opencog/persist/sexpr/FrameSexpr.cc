/// General comments: At this time, the only kinds of "Frames" are
/// AtomSpaces, and so the code below sometimes explcitly works with
/// AtomSpaces.  However, the Frame concept itself is meant to be
/// slightly more general. The idea is that Frames are kind-of-like
/// Nodes, and kind-of-like Links, in that they have a name and also
/// an outgoing set. Unlike Nodes, the name is mutable. Unlike Atoms,
/// Frames are not globally unique (at this time!?).  The general idea
/// is still experimental: it feels like Frames could be more generally
/// useful, but for right now, they are limited to just AtomSpaces.
///
/// The word "Frame" is meant to invoke the general idea of a "Kripke
/// frame". Its a DAG, a poset (a paritally ordereed set), its commonly
/// "complete", and thus resembles the concept of a frame from pointless
/// topology: i.e. a frames-and-locales style frame. The analogy is
/// imprecise.
///
/// The word "Frame" is also meant to invoke the idea of a C stackframe,
/// in that the contents of a Frame (the AtomSpace contents) is a
/// collection of all valid Atoms, for that frame. Since its a DAG, the
/// contents depends on all of the earlier frames, too.
