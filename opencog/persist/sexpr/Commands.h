	/// network services). The goal is to provide much higher
	/// performance than what is possible through the guile interfaces.
	///
	/// The supported commands are:
	///    cog-atomspace-clear
	///    cog-execute-cache!
	///    cog-extract!
	///    cog-extract-recursive!
	///    cog-get-atoms

	///    cog-link
	///    cog-node
	///    cog-set-value!
