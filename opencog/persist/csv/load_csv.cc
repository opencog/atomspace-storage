 * Load columns from a CSV file and place them into Atomese Values on

 *
 * The features (columns) specified in ignore_features will be omitted
 * from the representation.
 *
 * For example, a CSV dataset like this:
 * o, i1, i2, i3, i4
 * 1, 0, 0, 3.3, "foo"
 * 0, 1, 0, 4.4, "bar"
 *
 * will be loaded as the following key-value pairs on the `anchor` Atom:
 * (Predicate "*-column-names-*") (StringValue "o", "i1", "i2", "i3", "i4")
 * (Predicate "o") (BoolValue 1 0)
 * (Predicate "i1") (BoolValue 0 1)
 * (Predicate "i2") (BoolValue 0 0)
 * (Predicate "i3") (FloatValue 3.3 4.4)
 * (Predicate "i4") (StringValue "foo" "bar")
 *
