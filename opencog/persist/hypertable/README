                     HyperTable Support
                     ------------------

This directory uses Hypertable to support persistent and (eventually)
distributed storage of atoms. Three things are needed in order for it
to work:

1. HyperTable must be installed (of course). See http://hypertable.org

2. The Hypertable servers must be running. The command to start them is:
      <hypertable_install_dir>/bin/start-all-servers.sh <local | hadoop | kfs>

3. The Hypertable install directory and default configuration file need
   to be specified in opencog/persist/hypertable/AtomspaceHTabler.h
