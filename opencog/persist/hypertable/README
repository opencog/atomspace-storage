This directory uses Hypertable to support persistent and (eventually) distributed storage of atoms. Three things are needed in order for it to work:

1. Hypertable must be installed (of course).
2. The Hypertable servers must be running. The command to start them is:
        <install_dir>/bin/start-all-servers.sh <local | hadoop | kfs>
3. The Hypertable install directory and default configuration file need to be 
    specified in opencog/hypertable/AtomspaceHTabler.h
