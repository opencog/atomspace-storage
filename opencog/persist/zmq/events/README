The AtomSpacePublisherModule class publishes AtomSpace change events across 
the network using ZeroMQ sockets to allow for external clients to receive 
updates from the AtomSpace via a publish/subscribe pattern.

Clients can subscribe to the events by subscribing to a ZeroMQ socket.

Supported events are:

add
remove
tvchanged
avchanged

The default configuration parameters in opencog.conf are:

  ZMQ_EVENT_USE_PUBLIC_IP = TRUE
  ZMQ_EVENT_PORT = 5563

Detailed documentation, including a description of the JSON message format
specification and example client code is posted here:
