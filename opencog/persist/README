            AtomSpace Serializers and Deserializers (SerDes)
                 AKA "Communications and Persistence"
             -------------------------------------------

The AtomSpace may be converted from its native, in-memory C++ object
format, into any one of a number of "flattened", non-object formats.
These formats allow atoms to be sent to and received from remote systems,
as well as to be saved and restored from disk, file, database, network.

Systems include:

file       -- file-based storage.  Works, but deprecated.

hypertable -- experimental HyperTable support. Unmaintained.
              (Won't compile at this time.)

memcache   -- experimental/broken, uses memcached for persistence.
              (Won't compile at this time.)

sql        -- works well for most uses -- with caveats

xml        -- Obsolete XML-based file storage; will be removed soon.

zmq        -- ZeroMQ-based atomspace serialization and deserialization.
              Unmaintained.  (Won't compile at this time.)


The hypertable, memcache and sql systems all support networked,
peer-to-peer communications between cogservers.  (In principle ...
currently, needs test cases, and general work to enable/support).

Note that additional i/o methods can be found in the "visualization"
directory, which e.g. dump the entire atomspace into various graphics
formats.
