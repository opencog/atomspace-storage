MeTTa Import/Export
===================

A fraction of the MeTTa langauge can be easily imported as Artomese.
The code here is a proof of concept of this mapping.  At this time,
only the simplest mapping is done: the declaration of functions.

The code "works"; see the
[MeTTa example](../../../examples/foreign/metta-lisp.scm)
for a working demo.
