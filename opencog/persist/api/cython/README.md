Python API for Storage
----------------------
Same idea as the native scheme API, but for Python.
Currently, a minimalist implementation. A python version of everything
in PersistSCM.cc needs to be created. It's not hard, just the testing
is tedious.

Docmentation for all of these routines is on the OpenCog wiki. Start with
the [StorageNode](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/StorageNode) page, and move
from there. The docs are primarily written for scheme, the python bindings
are essentially identical in implementation and behavior, after adjusting
for parenthesis placement and adding commas.
